I cannot perform web research as I do not have access to a web browsing or search tool. My available tools are read_file and list_files, which are insufficient for conducting external research.

It appears the initial_research agent was unable to gather any data due to tool limitations. Since my role is to analyze research data, and no research data is available, I cannot proceed with data extraction and analysis. I will list the available files to see if there's any local data that might be relevant, although it's unlikely given the previous agent's output.
